As a student at the Warner College of Natural Resources, I have gained experience with various software and data processing tools to develop solutions for environmental projects. I have a basic understanding of ArcGIS, which I have applied in coursework (see project below). Currently, I am expanding my technical skills in Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science, where I am learning to code in R using RStudio and build websites, including this one.

## ArcGIS: Brooklyn Youth Parks Project

-   **Project Scope & Goal**: Developed the Brooklyn Youth Parks Project to increase green space access for children in high-density urban areas.
-   **GIS Analysis**: Utilized ArcGIS to analyze New York City boroughs, neighborhoods, parks, and demographics.
-   **Data-Driven Approach**: Identified areas lacking parks within a 0.25-mile radius and prioritized regions with over 2,000 residents under 18.
-   **Targeted Community Impact**: Determined Borough Park as a high-priority area needing a new park.
-   **Advocacy for Environmental Equity**: Promoted the importance of nature access for urban youth to support learning, creativity, and environmental empathy.![]()
