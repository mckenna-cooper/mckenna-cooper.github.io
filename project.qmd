During my Spring Semester of 2025, I took Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science. I learned how to utilize RStudio, GitHub, and Quarto to write code, showcase my projects for future employers, and make personalized websites. Super cool! below is the link to my github where you can see all of my current repositories. More coming soon!

-   Organized information into appropriate file pathways.
-   Did something I never thought I'd do: create a website!
