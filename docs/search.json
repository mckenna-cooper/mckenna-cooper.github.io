I became familiar with key functions such as filter(), slice(), arrange(), select(), mutate(), and summarize() to filter, reorder, modify, and summarize datasets. Using a Minnesota tree growth dataset, I practiced tasks like subsetting data, sorting, renaming columns, creating new variables, and summarizing statistics. I also explored advanced features like grouping data, using conditional statements with case_when(), and counting rows with n(). The lab helped me understand how to efficiently chain multiple operations with the pipe operator (%&gt;%), which streamlined the process of data wrangling and analysis."

Using the data set curated by the New York Times, I practiced filtering, grouping, and summarizing data, as well as handling population data from the Census to normalize the COVID data. I explored how to calculate new cases, cumulative cases, and death tolls at the county level in Colorado. I applied methods like lag and diff to calculate daily new cases and used rolling averages to smooth trends over time. I also visualized the data, creating tables and plots to present the most affected counties and track the virus’ movement. I learned how to compute weighted mean centers for COVID-19 cases and deaths to better understand the spatial dynamics of the outbreak. Additionally, I worked on using the flextable package to generate well-organized tables and ggplot2 to create insightful visualizations, including faceted bar plots and time-series plots. This lab helped me gain hands-on experience with integrating multiple data sets, processing time-sensitive data, and communicating findings effectively through both tables and visualizations."

I applied these tests to data from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, specifically focusing on Cutthroat trout and salamander species in Mack Creek, Oregon. I explored relationships between categorical variables, such as forest and channel types, using chi-square tests. I compared the mean weights of species in clear-cut versus old-growth forests using t-tests and examined the relationship between length and weight for different species using correlation tests. I also learned the importance of checking assumptions like normality and variance equality before conducting these tests."

We also learned how to format citations using Google Scholar and BibTeX, and integrate these references into our manuscript using Quarto’s citation system. Additionally, we began ideating for our final project by proposing two unique research ideas, detailing their significance, objectives, methods, and expected outcomes. This lab taught me how to organize a collaborative project, manage citations efficiently, and present research proposals in a structured format."

I explored the relationships between various environmental factors such as aridity, rainfall, and streamflow (q_mean) and examined how transformations, like log transformations, could improve the linearity of these relationships for model building. Additionally, I practiced using tools like data splitting, cross-validation, and model evaluation to prepare for building a predictive model for streamflow. The lab also involved creating map outputs to visualize predictions of streamflow across different geographic locations, allowing me to interpret the model results in a spatial context. The lab helped me gain hands-on experience in integrating data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation in a real-world environmental context."

We provided an overview of the problem we are addressing and outlined our proposed methods. This included conducting exploratory data analysis, creating visualizations, and considering the need for data cleaning and manipulation. We also identified our preliminary analysis methods, potential challenges in the data and methods, and any additional data we might need. The lab helped us organize our work, refine our approach, and anticipate any roadblocks ahead."

I gained hands-on experience with data preparation, including cleaning and transforming the data set, followed by splitting it into training and testing sets. I learned to create and apply feature engineering techniques through recipes and resample the data for cross-validation. The lab emphasized building and testing multiple machine learning models, followed by selecting and tuning the best-performing model. I explored hyperparameter tuning through grid search, evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared, and visualized results through plots. Lastly, I learned how to finalize a model and assess its performance on test data, culminating in a map of predictions and residuals. This lab gave me a comprehensive understanding of the machine learning workflow from start to finish."

This included distances to the national, state, Canadian, and Mexican borders. I also visualized these distances using ggplot and created maps highlighting specific cities. Additionally, I analyzed the 100-mile “border zone” and its implications, identifying cities within this zone and calculating their populations.
