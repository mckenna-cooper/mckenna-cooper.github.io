I became familiar with key functions such as filter(), slice(), arrange(), select(), mutate(), and summarize() to filter, reorder, modify, and summarize datasets. Using a Minnesota tree growth dataset, I practiced tasks like subsetting data, sorting, renaming columns, creating new variables, and summarizing statistics. I also explored advanced features like grouping data, using conditional statements with case_when(), and counting rows with n(). The lab helped me understand how to efficiently chain multiple operations with the pipe operator (%&gt;%), which streamlined the process of data wrangling and analysis."

Using the data set curated by the New York Times, I practiced filtering, grouping, and summarizing data, as well as handling population data from the Census to normalize the COVID data. I explored how to calculate new cases, cumulative cases, and death tolls at the county level in Colorado. I applied methods like lag and diff to calculate daily new cases and used rolling averages to smooth trends over time. I also visualized the data, creating tables and plots to present the most affected counties and track the virusâ€™ movement. I learned how to compute weighted mean centers for COVID-19 cases and deaths to better understand the spatial dynamics of the outbreak. Additionally, I worked on using the flextable package to generate well-organized tables and ggplot2 to create insightful visualizations, including faceted bar plots and time-series plots. This lab helped me gain hands-on experience with integrating multiple data sets, processing time-sensitive data, and communicating findings effectively through both tables and visualizations."

I applied these tests to data from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, specifically focusing on Cutthroat trout and salamander species in Mack Creek, Oregon. I explored relationships between categorical variables, such as forest and channel types, using chi-square tests. I compared the mean weights of species in clear-cut versus old-growth forests using t-tests and examined the relationship between length and weight for different species using correlation tests. I also learned the importance of checking assumptions like normality and variance equality before conducting these tests."
