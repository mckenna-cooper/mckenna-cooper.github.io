I became familiar with key functions such as filter(), slice(), arrange(), select(), mutate(), and summarize() to filter, reorder, modify, and summarize datasets. Using a Minnesota tree growth dataset, I practiced tasks like subsetting data, sorting, renaming columns, creating new variables, and summarizing statistics. I also explored advanced features like grouping data, using conditional statements with case_when(), and counting rows with n(). The lab helped me understand how to efficiently chain multiple operations with the pipe operator (%&gt;%), which streamlined the process of data wrangling and analysis."

Using the data set curated by the New York Times, I practiced filtering, grouping, and summarizing data, as well as handling population data from the Census to normalize the COVID data. I explored how to calculate new cases, cumulative cases, and death tolls at the county level in Colorado. I applied methods like lag and diff to calculate daily new cases and used rolling averages to smooth trends over time. I also visualized the data, creating tables and plots to present the most affected counties and track the virus’ movement. I learned how to compute weighted mean centers for COVID-19 cases and deaths to better understand the spatial dynamics of the outbreak. Additionally, I worked on using the flextable package to generate well-organized tables and ggplot2 to create insightful visualizations, including faceted bar plots and time-series plots. This lab helped me gain hands-on experience with integrating multiple data sets, processing time-sensitive data, and communicating findings effectively through both tables and visualizations."

I applied these tests to data from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, specifically focusing on Cutthroat trout and salamander species in Mack Creek, Oregon. I explored relationships between categorical variables, such as forest and channel types, using chi-square tests. I compared the mean weights of species in clear-cut versus old-growth forests using t-tests and examined the relationship between length and weight for different species using correlation tests. I also learned the importance of checking assumptions like normality and variance equality before conducting these tests."

We also learned how to format citations using Google Scholar and BibTeX, and integrate these references into our manuscript using Quarto’s citation system. Additionally, we began ideating for our final project by proposing research ideas, detailing their significance, objectives, methods, and expected outcomes. This lab taught me how to organize a collaborative project, manage citations efficiently, and present research proposals in a structured format."

I explored the relationships between various environmental factors such as aridity, rainfall, and stream flow (q_mean) and examined how transformations, like log transformations, could improve the linearity of these relationships for model building. Additionally, I practiced using tools like data splitting, cross-validation, and model evaluation to prepare for building a predictive model for stream flow. The lab also involved creating map outputs to visualize predictions of stream flow across different geographic locations, allowing me to interpret the model results in a spatial context. The lab helped me gain hands-on experience in integrating data pre-processing, visualization, and model evaluation in a real-world environmental context."

We provided an overview of the problem we are addressing and outlined our proposed methods. This included conducting exploratory data analysis, creating visualizations, and considering the need for data cleaning and manipulation. We also identified our preliminary analysis methods, potential challenges in the data and methods, and any additional data we might need.

I learned to create and apply feature engineering techniques through recipes and resample the data for cross-validation. The lab emphasized building and testing multiple machine learning models, followed by selecting and tuning the best-performing model. I explored hyper-parameter tuning through grid search, evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared, and visualized results through plots. Lastly, I learned how to finalize a model and assess its performance on test data, culminating in a map of predictions and residuals. This lab gave me a comprehensive understanding of the machine learning workflow from start to finish."

We outlined how our results relate to the broader field of data science and proposed next steps and open questions for future research. This lab allowed us to refine our analysis and start tying our findings into the larger context of our project."

Using data from Lassen Volcanic National Park, we found that water quality variables, particularly dissolved oxygen, had the strongest correlation with EPT richness. While vegetation cover was the least directly correlated, it showed indirect links by influencing dissolved oxygen and pH levels. Our analysis highlights the complexity of interactions between habitat structure and biotic communities, emphasizing the importance of maintaining riparian integrity to support biodiversity.\nPresented by: Sarah Culhane, Mckenna Cooper, & Archer Goodman (⚔ The TidyVerse Keepers ⚔)"
