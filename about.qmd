I am a fourth-year Ecosystem Science and Sustainability student at Colorado State University with a passion for building sustainable communities. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, sewing, and volunteering at a local community garden in Fort Collins. I am eager to expand my skills and explore new professional experiences, particularly in sustainability-focused project management. My goal is to contribute to initiatives that improve livelihoods and promote environmental balance through innovative and community-driven solutions. about
