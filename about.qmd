Hello, my name is Mckenna Cooper. I’m a fourth-year Ecosystem Science and Sustainability student at Colorado State University, set to graduate in December 2025. I’m passionate about building sustainable communities and hope to pursue a career that allows me to make a meaningful impact through sustainability-focused project management.

In my free time, I enjoy skiing, sewing, and volunteering at a local community garden in Fort Collins. I’m eager to grow professionally, expand my skill set, and contribute to innovative, community-driven solutions that promote environmental balance and enhance quality of life.
